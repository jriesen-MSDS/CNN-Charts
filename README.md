# CNN-Charts
 This information and inspiration was from https://github.com/YoheiKo/CNN-candle-stick I updated the information so it would
 run on my local machine and changed the stock inforamtion to the SPY ETF. 
 What I found very interesting is that accuracy between the train and validation were a bit spread wide in some instances. 
 I did find it interesting that train accuracy could get over 90% and sometimes the validation model would get over 80% 
 then go right back down.
 The goal of this is to see if I can get the predict of the next day for SPY to 90%. Next is getting stock charts created and labeled
